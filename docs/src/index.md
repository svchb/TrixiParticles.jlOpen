# TrixiParticles.jl

TrixiParticles.jl is a numerical simulation framework designed for particle-based numerical methods, with an emphasis on multiphysics applications, written in Julia. A primary goal of the framework is to be user-friendly for engineering, science, and educational purposes. In addition to its extensible design and optimized implementation, we prioritize the user experience, including installation, pre- and postprocessing. Its features include:

## Features
- Incompressible Navier-Stokes
  - Methods: Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH), Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility (EDAC)
- Solid-body mechanics
  - Methods: Total Lagrangian SPH (TLSPH)
- Fluid-Structure Interaction
- Output formats:
  - VTK
